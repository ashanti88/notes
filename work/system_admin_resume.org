*** Additonal Information
I am an enthusiastic FOSS advocate with a particular passion for anything *nix and find nothing more enjoyable than working with my home lab to learn different technologies both new and old. Iâ€™ve been working with the Linux operating systems for the last 9 years and enjoy nothing more than consolidating current skills and developing new ones. A large part of my free time is spent working with embedded systems and playing with latest offerings from Red Hat and a like.
