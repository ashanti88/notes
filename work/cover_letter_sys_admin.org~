Dear Sir/Madam

I was pleased to hear that you are currently looking for a Junior Linux Developer. I would like to apply, and feel that I’m well suited to the position. I have a passion for computing and in particular, networking and anything Linux.

As you will see from my resume I have experience in administering both Debian and CentOS severs. Though I feel more at home on a Debian system, CentOS is growing on me.

I have built up my skill set for Linux over the last seven years as a hobbyist, and consider myself to be very capable at performing essential tasks very efficiently with the tools available through the shell, and where the tools aren’t available I’m confident that I can script a solution.

Through my passion of Linux I developed a solid foundation in networking. I’m able to implement both LAN and WAN protocols and troubleshoot network problems with a systematic approach. I consider myself also to have a strong grasp of networking theory and the TCP/IP stack, and it is this that enables the systematic approach to troubleshooting.

I believe this is a position where my passion for this industry could grow. Thank you for taking the time for viewing my application and hope to hear from you in the near future.

Faithfully yours,
Alick Mitchell
