Dear Sir/Madam

I was pleased to hear that you are currently looking for a Service Desk Analyst. I would like to apply, and feel that I’m well suited to the position. I have a passion for computing and in particular, networking and anything Linux.

As you will see from my resume I have experience in administering DNS, Mail, FTP, HTTP, DHCP and SQL servers. I like to diversify my skills by changing the operating system in my home lab. I like to think that I have a very good grasp on NIX systems, often changing from FreeBSD, Fedora, SuSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Windows Server 2012 and whatever distros of Linux is in current fashion.

I have built up my skill set for Linux over the last seven years as a hobbyist, and consider myself to be very capable at performing essential tasks very efficiently with the tools available through the shell, and where the tools aren’t available I’m confident that I can script a solution.

Through my passion of Linux I developed a solid foundation in networking. I’m able to implement both LAN and WAN protocols and troubleshoot network problems with a systematic approach. I consider myself also to have a strong grasp of networking theory and the TCP/IP stack, and it is this that enables the systematic approach to troubleshooting.

I have extensive knowledge of the Cisco technologies and their ios and use cisco routers and switches within my home lab. I’m able to implement subnetting, understand cabling standards, and can work with PIX/ASA firewalls.  

I believe this is a position where my passion for this industry will grow because of the opportunities you provide for your employees. Thank you for taking the time for viewing my application and hope to hear from you in the near future.

Faithfully yours,
Alick Mitchell
