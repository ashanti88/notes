* Sysvinit
RedHat: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/installation_guide/s1-boot-init-shutdown-sysv
* Files
/etc/inittab - this file dictates what runlevel is to used as default
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
id:3:initdefault:
#+END_EXAMPLE
this would set runlevel 3 as the defualt runlevel
** Debian
/etc/rcX.d - this will hold symbolic link files to files in /etc/init.d. Depending up on the runlevel determines which service files are run 
/etc/rc.d/rc - this is a shell script that is responsible for starting and stopping services when the runlevel changes

** RHEL
/etc/rc.d - this directory is used to store each runlevel specification
/etc/rc.d/rcX.d/ - this will hold symbolic link files to files in /etc/init.d. Depending up on the runlevel determines which service files are run 
/etc/rc.d/rc     - this is a shell script that is responsible for starting and stopping services when the runlevel changes
/etc/rc.d/rc.local - this script is run last and allows for administrator to add any service initialization that they required

* Description

* Use
- List Services
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls /etc/init.d/
#+END_SRC

- Start a Service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/etc/init.d/sshd start
service sshd start
#+END_SRC

- Stop a Service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/etc/init.d/sshd stop
service sshd stop
#+END_SRC

- Enable a Service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd /etc/rc3.d
ln -s ../init.d/sshd S95sshd
#+END_SRC

- Remove a Service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rm /etc/rc3.d/S95sshd
#+END_SRC

** Service management with Debian/Ubuntu (update-rc.d)
- enable a service to start on Debian/Ubuntu system
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
update-rc.d sshd defaults
#+END_SRC
this would enable sshd to start on runlevels that were set as defaults in the /etc/init.d/sshd startup script 

- set none default runlevels for init script for Debian/Ubuntu
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
update-rc.d collectd start 85 3 5 . stop 85 0 1 6 .
#+END_SRC
here we are specifying exactly which runlevel should be used
85 would create it as S85 in the rc3.d directory

- disable a service using the defaults on Debian/Ubuntu
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
update-rc.d collectd remove
#+END_SRC

** Service management with RHEL/CentOS (chkconfig)


** Runlevels
- check current runlevel
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
runlevel
#+END_SRC
this will show the previous runlevel and the current runlevel

- to change the current runlevel
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
telinit 5
#+END_SRC
this would change the current runlevel to runlevel 5

** Shutdown and Reboot
- Reboot
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
reboot
#+END_SRC

- Poweroff
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
shutdown -P now
#+END_SRC

- Halt
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
shutdown -h now
shutdown -h +0
#+END_SRC
both occur immediately

- Cancel a shutdown
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
shutdown -c
#+END_SRC

** Configuring Network Services to Run on Boot
- configure telnet-server
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yum install -y telnet-server
yum install -y telnet
chkconfig xinetd on
service xinetd start
chkconfig telnet on
service telnet start
#+END_SRC
telnet is managed by the xinetd not sysvinit
