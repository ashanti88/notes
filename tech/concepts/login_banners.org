- as sshd doesn't know what type of terminal will be used to connect, none of the variables which can be used with the local login can be used with issue.net
- also the Banner variable in /etc/sshd_config has to be uncommented and set to /etc/issue.net
  

- create a message that is viewed after login
/etc/motd
