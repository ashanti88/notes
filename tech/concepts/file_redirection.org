#+TAGS: pipe redirection cat stderr stdin stdout


* File Redirection
* Files
/dev/stderr - this is a symlink to /proc/self/fd/2
/dev/stdin  - this is a symlink to /proc/self/fd/0
/dev/stdout - this is a symlink to /proc/self/fd/1

* Description
* Usage
  
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls /etc > etc.txt
ls /etc 1> etc.txt
#+END_SRC
both these are the same, just default behaviour is to rediredt stdout
  
** Redirecting errors
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat myfile666.txt 2> errors.txt
#+END_SRC

- redirect stdout and stderr to differnet files
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mount 1> mountfile 2> mounterror
#+END_SRC
this creates the two files

- redirect errors to null
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find / -iname "*.sh" 2> /dev/null
#+END_SRC
this will ensure that no error messges are printed to the screen

- redirect all output to /dev/null
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find / -iname "*.sh" 2>&1 > /dev/null
#+END_SRC

** Redirecting input

> command < input_text_or_file

- send /var/log/messages into the tail command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tail < /var/log/messages
#+END_SRC

- use sort to sort a file into alphabetical order
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sort < words.txt
#+END_SRC

** pipes
- need to save output and see it on the screen   
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find / -iname "*.sh" | tee results.log 2>&1 
#+END_SRC

- using the ls cmd with grep
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls /etc/ | grep cron
#+END_SRC
this will return only files that have cron in their name

- search files in a directory for a specific file
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -type f | grep "config.cfg"
#+END_SRC

- find specific filed and cut the second column
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cut -d" " -f3 file.txt | cut -c2
#+END_SRC
