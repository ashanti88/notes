- [[file://home/crito/org/tech/cmds/chown.org][chown]]  - change the owner/group of a file
- [[file://home/crito/org/tech/cmds/chgrp.org][chgp]]   - change the group of a file
- [[file://home/crito/org/tech/cmds/chattr.org][chattr]] - alter the attributes of a file
- [[file://home/crito/org/tech/cmds/chsh.org][chsh]]   - change the users shell

* Concepts
** Setuid
- The setuid (set user id) is a permission bit, that allows the users to exec a program with the permissions of the files owner
- Often used to temporarily elevate privileges.
- Is needed fpr proper system use.
- Normal users who can execute the file gain the privileges associated with the file.
- Useful but can be dangerous
- Some filesystems can be set to ignore the setuid attribute

  - the 's' in 'rws' for the user indicates that the setuid is configured for this file
    
- setting the uid
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod u+s file
chomd 4755 file
#+END_SRC

- check for files that have the suid set with the find cmd
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find /usr/bin -perm -4000
#+END_SRC

- well known cmds that normally have suid
  - passwd
  - ping
  - mount
  - umount
  - chage
  - gpasswd
  - newgrp
  - chfn
  - chsh
  - su
  - pkexec
  - crontab
  - Xorg
  - sudo
    
** Setgid
The setgid (set group id) is a bit that allows the user to exec a program with the permissions of the group owner.
     
[[file://home/crito/Pictures/org/setguid.png]]
  - the 's' in the group section indicates that the setguid is configured for this file/directory
    
- setting the guid bit
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod g+s guidexample
chmod 2755 guidexample
#+END_SRC

- finding files that have the gid set
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find / -perm -2000
#+END_SRC

- some cmds that usually have it set
  - write
  - mount.cifs
  - wall
  - locate
  - mount.ecryptfs_private
  - unix_chkpwd

** Sticky Bit
  - This prevents other users from deleting other users files
    - /tmp has the sticky bit set

[[file://home/crito/Pictures/org/sticky_bit.png]]

- setting the sticky bit
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod o+t stick_bit_dir
chmod 1755 stick_bit_dir
#+END_SRC

- who can delete the file
  - owner of the file can delete it
  - owner of the directory can delete it
  - root can delete it
