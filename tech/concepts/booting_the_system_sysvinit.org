#+TAGS: boot_process booting_with_sysvinit sysvinit


* Booting the System with sysvinit
* Files
/etc/inittab - this is where the default runlevel is set
/etc/rc.d    - this is where all the runlevel scripts can be found
/etc/rc.d/rcX.d - these are the runlevel scripts
/etc/rcX.d   - these sym-linked runlevel scripts to /etc/rc.d/rcX.d
/etc/init.d  - this is where the service scripts are kept
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
id:3:initdefault:
#+END_EXAMPLE
this would set the default runlevel to 3

* Description
* Usage
- What is sysvinit
  - a package that contains a group of processes that controll the basic function of the system.
  - the init process is the first application that the kernel loads after the boot loader starts the boot process.
  - the init application then controls the startup, running and shutdown of all other applications.
    
- Boot Process
  - System power on
  - BIOS loads
  - BIOS scans and hands off to the primary disk's boot sector
  - Boot sector provides the MBR, within the 512 bytes of the active drive
  - Boot loader is executed LILO/GRUB/GRUB2 begins
  - USER INPUT - depending on configuration
    - provide a passphrase for an encrypted disk
    - choose which kernel you would like to boot
    - choose which installed OS you would like to boot
  - Linux kernel is read and executed
  - Device initialization, module loading and the initial RAM disk (initrd) is loaded
  - Root filesystem is mounted
  - The init program loads
  - /etc/inittab is read and the appropriate runlevel scripts are run
  - Moudules indicated within the init scripts are loaded
  - Root filesystem is checked
  - Remaining local filesystems are mounted
  - Network devices are started
  - Init process rescas the /etc/inittab file and changes/sets the system to the indicated default runlevel and completes execution of scripts
  - runlevel scripts are executed in numeric order
  - TTY sessions are loaded (as listed in /etc/inittab)
  - System login prompt is displayed on the console, system is ready for login
    
- Runlevels (LBS/RHEL)
  0 - Halt(shutdown
  1 - Single User
  2 - Multi-User (no network or remote filesystems)
  3 - Full Multi-User (including networking and remote filesystems)
  4 - Unused
  5 - X11 (including networking and remote filesystems)
  6 - Reboot

- Init and RC Scripts
  - S - Starup script
  - K - Kill script
  - The start scripts are run first then then the kill scripts are run.
    - rc.local is always the last script to run
      - customized scripts should come before rc.local in all runlevels
