+ DNS - pairs user friendly labels to internet network addresses
+ DNSSEC - ensures accuracy of that information
  
+ Benefits of DNSSEC
  - Protects users
  - Strengthens trust in the internet
  - New possiblitities
  - Mitigate risk of cyber crime
    
+ The Problem
  - Not designed with security in mind
    - Malicious user can redirect non secured dns traffic
    - phising
    - wire tap 
    - stealing passwords
      

+ Anatomy of a Domain Name

  www.example.org.

 - www - subdomain
 - example - SLD - Second Level Domain
 - org - TLD - Top Level Domain
 - . - root
   
+ Terminology
  - Zones - delegated subsets of the hierarchical DNS structure
  - Resource Records (RR) - the data in zones, such as the mappings between domain namesand ip addrs. e.g. A, AAAA, MX, 
  - Nameserver (NS) - maintains a directory of domain names to their IP addresses. Nameservers are "The Internet's Phone Books"
    - responsible for the zone
      
+ Exploits
  - DNS Hijacking
  - DNS Spoofing
  - Cache Poisoning
  - Examples
    - Kaminsky Bug
    - Rogue DNS Servers
    - MITM
    - Direct Manipulation
    - Route Hijacking
      
+ Example - DNS Poisoning
  - Flood with fake answers
    - hoping that one is picked up
      

+ DNSSEC
  - DNS data originated from a legitimate sender
  - Data was not tampered in transit
  - Nonexistent data does not exist 

+ Does not provide
  - Provide confidentiality
  - Guarantee availability
  - Protect against compromised nameservers
    
+ when dns is queried with dnssec extra information is provided
  - DNSKEY - DNS Public Key
  - RRSIG - Resource Record Signature
  - DS - Delegation Signer
    
+ NSEC (Next Secure)
  - Points to the next name in the zone, if record queried does exist.
  - Zone-Walking
    - A side effect allows discovery of zone content.
  - NSEC3 - impedes zone-walking by using hashes
  - NSEC5 - improvement on NSEC3

+ DANE - DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities  
  - Secure Key Learning
  - Applications can easily discover authenticated ekys for sevices by using info available in DNS.
  - No longer dependent on CA and TLS
  - TLSA - TLS associations
    - Stores a cert or key for TLS.
    - Can work in conjunction with CA
  - Dane can authenticate and enforce TLS for the SMTP connection
  - other coms
    - VoIP
    - SIP
    - IM etc
  - Currently being worked on
    - OpenPGPKey - discoverable pgp
    - SMIMEA - discoverable S/MIME
    - IPSECA - IPsec for dane std
    - PMTA - Payment Association

+ Implementation
  - Storage - Expect zone files to increase at least 3x
  - CPU - There will be an increase to CPU load.
        - Resolvers caching helps
  - RAM - 4x as much 
  - Bandwidth - 5x as large
  - Compatibility - DNSSEC is an extension of DNS it was implimented in 1999, most hardware should be compatible.

+ Incomplete
  - "Last Mile" / "First Hop" Issue
    - validation between you and initial dns server.
  - Solutions
    - getdns - dnssec aware applications
    - fedora - validating resolvers 
    - MS - IPsec tunnel from every client to the DNS server
    - DNScrypt - authenticates coms between a DNS client and resolver
      
+ Servers
  - BIND9- DNS reference implementation can automate zone signing, even for dynamic zones.
  - PowerDNS - Database backend
  - Knot-DNS - High performance, scales well
  - NSD - Fast, simple, secure    
    
+ Tools
  - OpenDNSSEC
  - DNSSEC-Tools
