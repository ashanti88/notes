*Common Address Redundancy Protocol*

The Common Address Redundancy Protocol or CARP is a computer networking
protocol which allows multiple hosts on the same local area network to
share a set of IP addresses. Its primary purpose is to provide failover
redundancy, especially when used with firewalls and routers. In some
configurations CARP can also provide load balancing functionality. CARP
provides functionality similar to both VRRP and Cisco Systems'
proprietary protocol, HSRP. The protocol is implemented on several BSD
based operating systems, and has been ported to Linux.
