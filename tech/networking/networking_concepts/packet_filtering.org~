*Display IPTables*

iptables -vnL

*Use SAM's site to generate iptables code (iptabl.es)*

curl iptabl.es/accept/79.77.20.95/8443

*How to ADD/DELETE additional IP's to IPTables*

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 79.77.20.95 --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT

iptables -I INPUT -s 37.220.91.13 -j DROP

-I adds the line to the top of the table

-A appends it to the end

-D deletes the line instead of adding it

-s is the source IP

-j means that it jumps to the command specified afterwards i.e.
ACCEPT/REJECT/DROP

-p is the port type i.e. tcp

INPUT/OUTPUT mean incoming or outgoing

You can delete them based on what they're doing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    iptables -D INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p tcp --dport 111 -j ACCEPT
#+END_EXAMPLE

--------------

Or you can delete them based on their number and chain name:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    iptables -D INPUT 4
#+END_EXAMPLE

--------------

*Save the additions to IPTables *

service iptables save

As per our call, if you want to lock down your server to only a select
number of IPs, then adding iptables rules on your server is probably the
quickest way to sort this. Though we don't support iptables rules (there
can be a lot that can go wrong, and people can lock themselves out of
their own server), here are a few tips to get you sorted;

The above guide would help you massively, but make sure you have a good
read through it first before diving in. Here is an example to allow
access to a specific port for a specific IP

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport theportnumber -s ip.ip.ip.ip -j ACCEPT

You would need to add all the IPs you need FIRST (including ours >
80.244.179.100). Once happy with this, you would block everyone else.

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport theportnumber -j DROP

'I' inserts at the top of the 'iptables -vnL' list, while 'A' appends.
This is useful to remember, as any 'Appended' rules will only take
effect AFTER rules before it (ie. top of the list gets first say on
what's happening). Following this formula, you should be able to
restrict server access on specific ports.
