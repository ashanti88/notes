** KVM and QEMU Internals - Understanding the IO subsystem - Kyle Bader :openstack:
   
+ Full virtualization and Paravirtualization
  - Full 
    - runs normal guest os iso
    - slow
    - trap emulate
    - doesn't require intel-VT or AMD-V extensions

  - Paravirtualization
    - best for I/O performance.
    - requires modification of guest os.
    - virtio-blk and virtio-scsi
      - either of these drivers can be choosen on the glance image.  
	
+ AIO Modes in Nova
  - Asynchronious IO
    - uses kernel AIO io_submit(2)
    - can help performance, but io_submit can block causing jitter in VM(missed ticks)
  - Synchronious IO
    - default in Nova
    - pread64, pwrite64 calls
    - userspace implementation of AIO using thread pool.

+ Caching modes available in QEMU
  - uses host caching
  - guest disk WCE
  - rbd_cache
  - rbd_max_dirty

- cache modes are influenced by Nova.
- Example: disk_cachemodes='writeback' in nova.conf
- forces same cache behaviour for all vm's and cinder volume types

*** L^
- Supermicro - mentioned with percona
- gorilla scalability model - neil gunther
- rbd based cluster
