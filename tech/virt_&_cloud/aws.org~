*** How to build a cloud presence
1. Going to the cloud: Traditional Method
Build your own cloud placing your equipment in a data center.
2. Going to the Cloud: AWS Method
Use AWS services to create your infrastructure.

**** Traditional Method
+ Setting up
  - Select a Data Center
  - Purchase Rack Space
  - Purchase Internet Connectivity
  - Install Equipment
    - Switches
    - Firewalls
    - Servers
    - Storage - SAN or NAS
  - Configure Services
  - Expand to More Data Centers - Locality is important when it comes to serequipmentvices such as VOIP
+ Pros & Cons:
  - Massive up-front cost, BIG "Steps"
  - IT Staff: focus on the data center 
  - In-House knowledge limits
  - recreate the wheel
  - It's yours
  - "Monster Server" Capabilities

**** AWS Method
+ Setting up
  - Pick your region
  - Pick your availability zone - these are physical data centers
    - for redundancy you should look at rolling out in to more than one zone
  - Provision your server
  - Configure services
  - Expand to other availability zones
  - Expand to other regions
+ Pros & Cons:
  - Pay As You Go; Pricing Models
  - Elastic Computing; Grow as needed
  - Economy of scale
  - Immediate security accreditation
  - Multiple data centers easily
  - Collaborative innovation
  - horizontal scaling

**** Vertical Vs Horizontal Scaling
***** Vertical Scaling 
  - Increasing HW
  - Increasing Capacity
  - Easy to do

***** Horizontal Scaling (scale out):
  - Increasing instances
  - Shared capacity
  - Typically requires planning

*** Getting Started with AWS
**** What you need to get started
- A Purpose
- Logon Information/Email Address
- A Credit Card/Phone number
***** An Understanding of the services
  - Cloudwatch 
    - Monitors all of the services
    - Can start to get expensive
  - EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
    - allows os templates to be created with specific functions db, web etc
    - public available timeplates
  - S3 - Simple Storage Service 
    - written to at least two places
    - Where your image is held whilst not being run
  - EBS - Elastic Block Store
    - faster than S3
    - optional to running image on the ephemeral memeory of the server
      - means that when the machine is shutdown it's data isn't lost
  - Route 53
    - create name records for your domains
    - manages dns
  - VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
    - site to site cloud
  - Auto Sacling
    - amazon automated server management tool
    - will spin up servers when certain limits are reached 
    - shutdown instances when website hits a lull
  - CloudFormation
  - IAM - Identity and Access Management
    - create credentials to access system
  - ELB - Elastic Load Balancing
  - SimpleDB/DynamoDB
    - simpleDB now discontinued
    - Dynamo is really fast
