* Description
polkit provides an authorization API intended to be used by privileged programs (“MECHANISMS”) offering service to unprivileged programs (“SUBJECTS”) often through some form of inter-process communication mechanism. In this scenario, the mechanism typically treats the subject as untrusted. For every request from a subject, the mechanism needs to determine if the request is authorized or if it should refuse to service the subject. Using the polkit APIs, a mechanism can offload this decision to a trusted party: The polkit authority.
