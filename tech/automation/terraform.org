* Description
Modules in the Terraform ecosystem are a way to organize the code to: 
  - be more reusable
  - avoid code duplication
  - improve the code organization and its readability

If we compare them to a programming language, writing a Terraform module is the equivalent of writing a function and calling it many times with different parameters.
