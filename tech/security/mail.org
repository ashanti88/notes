** Using the VRFY cmd
We can verify whether e-mail accounts exist on a server is simply to telnet to the server on port 25 and run the VRFY command. The VRFY command makes a server check whether a specific user ID exists. Spammers often automate this method to perform a directory harvest attack, which is a way of gleaning valid e-mail addresses from a server or domain.
