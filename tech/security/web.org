1. Is the site using CF or not
   - check dns - is it a CF DNS server
2. Once we have confirmed that site is using CF
   - http://www.crimeflare.com/cfs.html this will provide a search for domains
   - if this draws a blank then https://searchdns.netcraft.com/ can be used to check history, for previous ip before moving to CF
3. Interrogate the DNS Server
   - Admin may not have moved all the subdomains, mx records etc
   - dig [A IP AAAA MX SOA SRV CNAME PTR SPF TXT] blueleves.co.uk
4. Using email
   - send an email to anyone@bluelevers.co.uk
     - this may produce an error email from the correct ip address
