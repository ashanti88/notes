* proxychains							    :sec:net:
* Description
Allows the use of proxies to tunnel cmds through
* Files
/etc/proxychains.conf
* Usage
set to tor by default, comment out if you don't want to go through tor.

- add new proxies at the bottom of the file.
<protocol> <ip_addr> <port>
socks5 213.34.45.111 1080

** Dynamic chaining
- this will allow for multiple proxies to be used, if one fails it will move over to the next
- uncomment
  - dynamic_chain
** Random chaining
- this will provide pseudo randomness to proxychains 
- uncomment
  - random_chain
  - dynamic_chain
  - chain_len

** Using Nmap
- the only scan that can be performed through proxychains is the -sT
- this is due to tcp connections are a must, is any other scan is chosen nmap will fall out of proxychains, and revert to using your host ip
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
proxychains nmap -sT 93.45.23.01
#+END_SRC
- recommend that you use tcpdump whilst scan is being performed and ensure that the target never appears, if target ip shows kill scan
- dns will still be resolved by your dns, use tor-resolve to mitigate this
