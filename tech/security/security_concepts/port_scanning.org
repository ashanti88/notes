port 0 is used as a wildcard to indicate any available port.

this port can be used by a trojan to allow stealthy access to a system.

nmap allows for the scanning of port 0 when explicitly set.

> nmap -p0-x <address>

Ephemeral port ranges

Many Linux machines - 32768 - 61000

Man BSD use 1024-5000

windows 2003 - 1025 - 3976

windows 2008 - 10000 - 10999

this range can be found in linux with 

> cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip\_local\_port\_range

IANA uses a different system to seperate out ports

well-known ports -1-1023

registered ports - 1024 - 49151

dynamic ports - 49152 - 65535

By default nmap will scan the 1000 most popular ports of each protocol
it is asked to scan.

Nmap and port status

there are 6 states

open - actively acceptind tcp/udp packets on this port.

closed - is accessible ( it receives and responds to nmap probe packets,
but there's no application running on the port.

filtered - nmap can't determine if the port is open, because packet
filtering prevents the probe from reaching the port. The filtering may
be from a dedicated device, router rules or host-based firewall. 

unfiltered - the port is accessible, but nmap is unable to determine
whether it is open or closed. Only the ACK scan uses this status, other
scan types will clear this state up.

open|filtered - unable to determine if open or filtered.

closed|filtered - unable to determine if closed or filtered.

Timing-related options

timings are assumed to be in milliseconds unless otherwise stated by
appending s (seconds), m (minute) or h (hours) to the value.

Port scan performance options

-T0 through -T5

slowest through to fastest

--min-rtt-timeout, --max-tt-timeout, --initial-rtt-timeout

The minimum, maximum and initial amount of time that nmap will wait for
a port scan probe response.

--host-timeout

Asks nmap to give up on hosts that take more than the given amount of
time to scan.

--min-rate, --max-rate

Sets the upper and lower limits for number of probe packets nmap sends
per second.

--max-retries

Specifies the maximum number of port scan probe retransmission to a
single port.
