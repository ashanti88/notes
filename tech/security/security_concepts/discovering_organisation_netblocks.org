using host to query common DNS record types

> host -t ns <domain.com>

-t - record type

ns - nameserver

> host -t a <domain.com>

a - the ip address of the domain

> host -t aaaa <domain.com>

aaaa - the ipv6 address of the domain

> host -t soa <domain.com>

soa - source of authority for dns records

These commands provide a starting point for further investigation.
Thourgh zone transfer requests are denied by most dns servers it is
worth trying in the off chance against all ns records that are found. 

Attempting a zone transfer

> dig @found\_ns\_address -t AXFR <domain.com>

Ensure that domain is owned by said organisation

> whois <domain.com/address>

Finding smaller companies ISP ip allocation

Some isp's use Shared Whois (SWIP) or Referral Whois (RWhois). Both of
these will provide the companies netblock.

We can't search whois for specific company but there are other search
queries that can help

> whois -h whois.arin.net @<domain.com>

this will search for all contacts with an email address at domain.com

> whois -h whois.arin.net "n domain*"

this shows all the netblock handles that start with domain

> whois -h whois.arin.net "o domain*"

this will search all organisation names starting with domain

arin - north america

ripe - europe/russia/middle east

afrinic - africa

apnic - asia/au/nz

lacnic - latin america
