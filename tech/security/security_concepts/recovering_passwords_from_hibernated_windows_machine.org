* Recovering Passwords from Hibernated Windows Machines            :win:pass:
* Work-through
1. boot the machine with a kali live image

2. determine which partition has windows installed
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
fdisk -l
#+END_SRC

3. mount the partition that holds windows with read write permissions
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir windows_box
mount -t ntfs -o rw /dev/sda3 windows_box/ 
#+END_SRC

4. Due to hibernation you won't be able to mount the partition with rw, and will recieve this message.

This is caused by the hiberfil.sys file created by the system not being shutdown correctly.

5. Using NTFSFIX and NTFS-3G we can remedy this problem and mount the partition.
- run ntfsfix on the partition
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ntfsfix /dev/sda3
#+END_SRC
- makesure parttion isn't mounted
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
umount /dev/sda3
#+END_SRC
- finally mount the parttion with ntfs-3g and remove the hibernation file 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda3 windows_box/
#+END_SRC

6. Partition is now mounted and the sticky keys backdoor can be used to recover the password.
