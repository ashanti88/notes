* Walk-through
1. boot the windows machine with a Kali live image

2. find the partition that holds the windows installation
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
fdisk -l
#+END_SRC

3. mount the windows installation in with read write permissions
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir windows
mount -t ntfs -o rw /dev/sda3 windows/
#+END_SRC

4. navigate to the sam file that holds the login credentials
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd Windows/System32/config
#+END_SRC

5. run the chntpw cmd on the SAM file in this directory
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chntpw -l SAM
#+END_SRC

6. select the user whose password we need to change
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chntpw -u "Administrator" SAM
#+END_SRC
[[file://home/crito/Pictures/org/chntpw_output.png]]
We now have the option of clearing the password, resetting it or promoting user to admin. 
Changing password doesn't always work on win7, so better to clear and log in with blank password.
