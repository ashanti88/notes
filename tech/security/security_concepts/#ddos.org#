- SockStress
  - flow control - window size of 0 - can not send anymore - Sever keeps process up
    - open many process and kill the server
    
- New RA Flood
  - Each RA now contains
    - 17 Route information sections
    - 18 Prefix information sections
  - How to perform this attack
    - for best results use a gigabit ethernet NIC on attacker and a gigabit switch
    - use thc-ipv6 2.3 on kali
    - two terminal windows:
      1. ./fake_router6 eth a::/64
      2. ./flood_router26 eth1
    - Windows dies within 30 seconds

  - Mitigation 
    - Disable IPv6 - not practical
    - Turn off Router Discovery with netsh
    - use a firewall to block rogue RAs
    - Get a switch with RA Guard
    - MS "IPv6 Readiness Update"
      
- Annoyance attacks 10-80Gbps range
- 60Gbps - to this to take down american banks  

- what is need to a quick, dirty and dangerous ddos
  - a list of open dns resolvers - misconfigured dns servers
  - some servers running on networks that allow source IP spoofing
    
- send as much as you can
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dig ANY isc.org @63.217.84.76 +edns=0 +notcp +bufsize=4096
#+END_SRC
this amplification is 50x

- Good networks don't let packets originate from IPs they don't own (BCP38)
- lots of bad networks that allow spoofed ips
