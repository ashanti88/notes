* Files
** /etc/ssh/ssh_config 		
- the config file for the ssh client

** /etc/ssh/sshd_config 		
the config file for the ssh daemon
** /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys  
this holds remote hosts public keys
** /home/user/.ssh/config  	
this is a way to save host configs
** /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts     
this file holds hashes for all known hosts, hosts that we have previously connected to and authorize that we trust them to be the correct machine.

** Cmds
*** ssh-copy-id
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-copy-id crito@192.168.0.5
#+END_SRC
You will be prompted for your password, if no ssh key configured
*** ssh-agent
To enable the ssh-agent
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
eval $(ssh-agent)
#+END_SRC

*** ssh-add
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/git_eurus
#+END_SRC
*** ssh-keygen
*** ssh-copy-id
ssh-copy-id uses the SSH protocol to connect to the target host and upload the SSH user key. The command edits the authorized_keys file on the server. It creates the .ssh directory if it doesn't exist. It creates the authorized keys file if it doesn't exist. Effectively, ssh key copied to server.

It also checks if the key already exists on the server. Unless the -f option is given, each key is only added to the authorized keys file once.

It further ensures that the key files have appropriate permissions. Generally, the user's home directory or any file or directory containing keys files should not be writable by anyone else. Otherwise someone else could add new authorized keys for the user and gain access. Private key files should not be readable by anyone else.
* Description
* Usage
** ssh Key Generation
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-keygen
#+END_SRC
This will then prompt for a name for the new key

** Check an ssh keys password
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa
#+END_SRC
If this key has a passphrase you will be challenged. 
To unload the key
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-add -d .ssh/id_rsa
#+END_SRC
** Generate public key from private key
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-keygen -y -f .ssh/private_key > .ssh/private_key.public
#+END_SRC

** Enable key only auth
- this will allow only key auth, no password auth
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
PasswordAuthentication no
#+END_EXAMPLE
this is the only variable that needs to be changed

** Secure Configuration
*** Network Options
Port 5000 - not usign the default port(22) can avoid common runs agains this port. Sometimes this is not a good idea due to certain application expecting the standard port, this should be considered.

AddressFamily inet - this only allows traffic over ipv4 not ipv6.

ListenAddress 192.168.1.0 - this will mean that the service will only listen on the local network 192.168.1.0, and not be accessable from the internet. ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 will allow the service to be accessed from all addresses.

Protocol 2 - this will only allow protocol 2 to be used, protcol 1 has known weaknesses that can allow exploitation of the service. 

X11Forwarding no - A prefered method for VNC is to tunnel it over ssh, this my be required for certain applications.

TCPKeepalive no - These are sent outside of the encrypted channel and can be spoofed, ClientAliveInterval is encrypted and is unspoofable so works as an alternative.

ClientAliveInterval 60 - secure alternative to TCPKeepalive.

ClientAliveCountMax 3 - The number of attempts that the sshd will illicit a response from the ssh client before disconnecting. Unresponsive ssh client will be disconnected after 3 minutes.

*** Key Configuration
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key - these are the default host key locations
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key

UsePrivilegeSeparation yes - this option splits up server processors in an attempt to prevent privilege escalation

PubkeyAuthentication yes - Use public key authentication for access. Using this option in conjunction with PasswordAuthentication no, means only uses with correct key can access the server.

AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys - this is the location that remote hosts public keys are kept who will have access.

*** Authentication

AllowUsers user_one user_two - White list the users that can login to the server, this is a space seperated list.

LoginGraceTime 60 - this provides a 60 second window to login to the system when prompted

PermitRootLogin no - Disable root logins completely, not save practice to be login to a server as root, use sudo or wheel group once logged in.

StrictModes yes - this forces the correct permissions of key files, must not be writable by anyone but the owner.

IgnoreRhosts yes - Ignore Rhosts authentication for .rhosts and .shorts files in RhostsRSAAuthentication or HostbasedAuthentication /etc/hosts.equiv is still used if the the HostBasedAuthentication option is not disabled.

HostBasedAuthentication no - Decides if rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv and a public key is are allowed (host-based authentication.

IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes - This determines if the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file is to be ignored. When accessing multiple boxes on the same ip.

PermitEmptyPasswords no - Password is required for access. In this configuration a key is required.

ChallengeResponseAuthentication no - This is not required as wee aren't using login or password authentication.

PasswordAuthentication no - With this disabled a key is required to login to the server.

UsePAM no - not needed as we aren't using password authentication.

UseLogin no - as priviliege seperation is used login isn't required.

SyslogFacility AUTH - log sshd messages to the AUTH syslog facility, which stores its messages in /var/log/auth.log 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grep sshd /var/log/auth.log
#+END_SRC

LogLevel INFO - Defines verbosity of login. Available options SILENT, QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG2 and DEBUG3. INFO is default

PrintLastLog yes - When user logs in print the last login time. Good option for unauthorized access analysis.

MaxAuthTries 2 - This is the number of attemps that can be tried per connection. Failures are logged after half the number is reached.

Banner /etc/issue.net - this is the banner that greets a user at login

#+END_EXAMPLE

** Copy new public key to remote server
- this will assume that you are connecting to a user with the same username as you
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-copy-id 78.87.56.34
#+END_SRC

- here we are specifiying which user we would like to sort the key under
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-copy-id frank@78.87.56.34
#+END_SRC

** Many keys set
Using ssh-agent with multiple keys can cause problems when login into many servers.
Each key is considered an attempt, so if a limit is set then you can end up locked out.
** Setting up ssh-agent as a sysd service
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[Unit]
Description=SSH key agent

[Service]
Type=forking
Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/ssh-agent.socket
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ssh-agent -a $SSH_AUTH_SOCK

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Adding to zshrc
- add this line to .zshrc
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.socket"
#+END_EXAMPLE
** add key/identity
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-add $KEY
#+END_SRC

** Check what identities are currently set
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-add -l
#+END_SRC

** remove key/identity
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-add -d $KEY
#+END_SRC

** remove all keys/identities
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-add -D
#+END_SRC

** Changing SSH port

vi /etc/ssh/sshd\_config

change port to 22 (or any other number) or add another line to add
another port

service sshd reload
** Disable root login
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
PermitRootLogin no
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Only allow ssh protocol v2
