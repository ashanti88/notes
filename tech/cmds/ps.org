* ps
* Description
* Usage
- view current processors on the system
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ps aux
#+END_SRC
a - select all processes
u - use username not uid
x - lifts the "must have a tty" restriction

- using forest to link parents and children
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ps auxf
#+END_SRC
f - forest

** View the process status and WCHAN field (hung process)
- This will show WCHAN, the address of the kernel function where the process is sleeping. Running tasks will show "-"
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ps -flp 1597
#+END_SRC
l - BSD long format 

The whcan field can be found for the process at /proc/1597/wchan

If viewing a process in stat "D", next look at /proc/pid/status
 - in here there's two values 
   voluntary_ctxt_switches:
   nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches:
   these two values tell us how many times a process has been taken off the cpu (or put back)
 - if these two values don't increase after a few seconds, this is a good indication that the process has hung
 - these context switches can also befound /proc/pid/sched
   nr_switches
   nr_voluntary_switches
   nr_involuntary_switches
   
  - the nr_switches value which is the combined value of both can be found on at /proc/pid/schedstat it's the thrid value
    
** SELinux Contexts
ps -eZ

** Nice values of processes
ps -ax -o pid,ni,cmd This will show the nice value of the processes

rtprio - real time priority
** search a specific process
- is postfix running
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ps aux | grep -i postfix | grep -v grep
#+END_SRC
adding "grep -v grep" stops the grep on postfix being printed

** Split kernel and user space
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ps eH
#+END_SRC
e - every process
H - Hierarchy (forest)
This will first print the kernel processors, and will then print the userland processors
