* Description
* Usage

> useradd <login>

This creates a normal user issues a uid, gid, but no home directory is created ( but is set in the /etc/passwd ). Shell is set from the default settings. No password is set and the user is unable to login until one is set. Once a password is set the user can now login, but will enter at /home (this is set in useradd default), until the home directory is created.

** Configure a user with custom settings

> useradd -s <shell> -m -d <home dir> -g <group> UserName

s - shell
m - create users home directory if it doesn't already exist
d - home directory of the user
g - group name
G - group names

UserName - Login id

- Adding new user to group?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
useradd -G admins,ftp,www,developers jerry
#+END_SRC
this only works with new users
