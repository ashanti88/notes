* sort
* Description
Sort starts its sort by default from the 0 column. This means that 11 comes before 2.

The sort cmd doesn't effect the original file, the output is required to be redirected.

* Usage
- basic sort (default alpha)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sort file.txt
#+END_SRC

- sort numerically
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sort -n file.txt
#+END_SRC

- sort by number of occurences
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat syslog | uniq -c -w 6 | sort -h
#+END_SRC

- sort by numeric value
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sort -n numbers.txt
#+END_SRC
this will ensure that 2 is sorted before 11, unlike the default behaviour that sorts starting with column 0.

- sort by the second delimited field (delimited by space or tab)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sort -k2 -n numbers.txt
#+END_SRC
