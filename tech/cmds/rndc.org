/etc/rndc.key - this is the key that rndc uses to connect to the named service securely. On RHEL this is created when the named service is started
* Description
* Usage
  
- flush the named cache
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rndc flush
#+END_SRC
this will flush all stored domain information

- flush a specific domain
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rndc flushname cnn.com
#+END_SRC
  
** Create a new rndc.key
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rndc-confgen -r /dev/urandom -a
#+END_SRC
a random seed is required for the key to be created
  
- this will then need to be added to the /etc/named.conf
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
zone "." IN {
        type hint;
        file "named.ca";
};

key "rndc-key" {
      algorithm hmac-md5;
      secret "U7/L4YKs4Fg4wQ8eL5IKmg==";
};

controls {
      inet 127.0.0.1 port 953
              allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "rndc-key"; };
};

include "/etc/named.rfc1912.zones";
include "/etc/named.root.key";
#+END_SRC

- the rndc.conf has to be changed to the named group
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chgrp named /etc/rndc.conf
#+END_SRC

- the key by default will allow read access to all this need to be changed
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod 640
#+END_SRC

- restart the named service and the new key should be available 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
systemctl restart named
#+END_SRC

- confirm that you can connect to the named server
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rndc status
#+END_SRC

- you may get an error indicating that an /etc/rndc.key is present but the /etc/rndc.conf is being used. If this occurs just delete the rndc.key
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rm /etc/rndc.key
#+END_SRC
