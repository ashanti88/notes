#+TAGS: ar binutils archives


* ar
* Description
A utility for creating, modifying and extracting from archives.
* Usage
ar is part of binutils

** Accidental deletion of the dpkg package means that .debs are no long able to be installed
- we would first down load a copy of dpkg_1.17.23_amd64.deb (whatever the current version is)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/dpkg/dpkg-dev_1.19.0.5_all.deb
#+END_SRC

- we can now extract the data.tar.gz
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tar -xzf data.tar.gz
#+END_SRC
this may be in xz compression

- copy the binary for the data.tar.gz to /usr/bin
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cp ./usr/bin/dpkg /usr/bin/
#+END_SRC

- you should have a working version of dpkg
