locate is faster than find as it relies on a database of the files on
the filesystem.

the database is usually updated with a cron script but can be updated
manually with

> updatedb

*Basic usage*

> locate <query>

options

b - basename - find only the files that have the query itself, instead
of directories that contain th query leading to it

e - exist

S - statstics - see statistics about the information that locate has
cataloged
