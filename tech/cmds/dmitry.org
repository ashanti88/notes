* Description
DMitry (Deep Magic Information Gathering Tool)
* Usage
The tool is a little dated and might be better to use other tools

> dmitry <option> <domain.com>

** Options (linux style)
i - Perform an internet number whois lookup on target
w - Perform whois on target
o - save output to said file
n - retrieve Netcraft.com information on the target
s - perform a search for possible subdomains
e - perform a search for possible email addresses
p - perform a port scan on target
f - perform port scan and show any filtered ports
b - read in the banner received from the scanned portÂ 
t [0-9] - ttl when scanning a tcp port ( this option requires the p flag to be passed)

** Examples
- Perform all scans
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dmitry -winsepfbo bluelevers.out.txt bluelevers.co.uk
#+END_SRC

- Simple scan
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dmitry -wnseo angling-news.co.uk
#+END_SRC
This will output a file to angling-news.co.uk as no file is specified

- Port scan
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dmity - pbo angling-news.port.txt angling-news.co.uk
#+END_SRC
This will do a simple port scan of the domain, only scanning 150 ports
Nmap would be far better for this
