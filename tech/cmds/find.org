** Find file by name
We can use either
  - name - casesensitive
  - iname - case insensitive
Regular expression symbols can be used    
- find all files in current and sub directories that end in .conf
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -name "*.conf"
#+END_SRC
** Find file by type
Types that can be searched for
  - f - regular file
  - d - directory
  - l - symbolic link
  - c - character device
  - b - block device

- find all directories and sub-directories
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -type d 
#+END_SRC

- search by file can also be used to search for the .conf files like above
#+BEGIN_SRC 
find . -type f -name "*.conf"
#+END_SRC

** Find file by regex
- this will find all files in the current directory and subdirectories 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -regex ".*django.*"
#+END_SRC
As find will search the fqdn .* has to be the first term

** Finding files by size
We can use the size flag with size descriptions
  - c - bytes
  - k - kilobytes
  - M - Megabytes
  - G - Gigabytes
  - b - 512-byte-block
    
- find all files above 100MB
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -size +100M
#+END_SRC

** Find files at certain depth
To descend into sub-directories use the maxdepth flag
#+BEGIN_SRC 
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "history"
#+END_SRC
1 will search in the set directory
2 will move down one directory etc...
** Find by user
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -maxdepth -user crito -name "*.py"
#+END_SRC
This will find all crito's python files in current directory

** Delete found files
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -name "pattern" -exec rm -rf {} \;
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -name "pattern" -delete
#+END_SRC
** Count files in directory recursively
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -type f | wc -l
#+END_SRC
** Print only the file name 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -type f -printf '%f\n
#+END_SRC
