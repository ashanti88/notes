* Description
Report Central Processing Unit (CPU) statistics and input/output statistics for devices and partitions.

* Usage
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ iostat <options> <device> <interval> <num_capture>
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Options
c - Display cpu statistics
d - Display i/o statistics
n - Display network statistics
t - Display timestamp information
x - Display extended information
m - output in mb/s

** Show only the disk every 2 seconds for 10 times
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
iostat -d /dev/sda 2 10
#+END_SRC


** Output
%user - The percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (this is the application usage).
%nice - The percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority.
%system - The percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel).
%iowait - The percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.
%steal - The percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.
