* localectl
* Description
System-wide locale settings are stored in the /etc/locale.conf file, which is read at early boot by the systemd daemon. The locale settings configured in /etc/locale.conf are inherited by every service or user, unless individual programs or individual users override them. 

The basic file format of /etc/locale.conf is a newline-separated list of variable assignments. For example, German locale with English messages in /etc/locale.conf looks as follows: 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
LC_MESSAGE=C
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage
- current locale status
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
localectl status
#+END_SRC

- list available locales
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
localectl list-locales
#+END_SRC

- Setting the locale
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
localectl set-locale LANG=en_GB.utf8
#+END_SRC
