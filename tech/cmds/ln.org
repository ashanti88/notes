#+TAGS: ln coreutils links symbolic_links hard_links


* ln
* Description
linux uses two types of links soft and hard.
  - Soft being a reference to another file path.
  - Hard being a reference to another file inode.

* Usage
** Creating a hard link

> ln <file\_path\_orig> <file\_path\_link>

** Creating a soft link
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ln -s /home/user/test1.txt /home/user/test2.txt
#+END_SRC
test2.txt is now a symbolically linked file to test1.txt

** Links over different partitions
Only symbolic links can be created across partitions

** Link two directories with different names
- make sure that the directory that is going to be the sym link isn't already created
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ln -s /media/sf_Dropbox /home/user/dropbox
#+END_SRC
