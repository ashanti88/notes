* ddrecue							  :sys:op:io:
* Description
* Usage
- Basic Rescue
The first command copies as much as possible, without retries. The second command goes over the damaged filesystem again, and makes three retries to copy everything.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ddrescue -f --no-split /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 logfile
ddrescue -f -r3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 logfile
#+END_SRC
To copy an entire drive use just the drive name, for example /dev/sdb and don't specify a partition.

- Restoring the Recovered Image
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dd if=/dev/sdd1 of=/dev/sdc1
#+END_SRC
