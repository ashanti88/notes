* curl
* Description
curl is a command line tool which is used to transfer data over the internet. It began as a project by Daniel Stenberg to transfer data over HTTP but has now evolved into a very robust tool that transfers data not just over HTTP but also FTP, TELNET, IMAP, and many more.
* Usage
- fetch the website html
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl www.bbc.co.uk
#+END_SRC

- fetch the head information for website
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -I www.bbc.co.uk
curl --head www.bbc.co.uk
#+END_SRC

- using verbose output
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -vI www.bbc.co.uk
#+END_SRC
this will create extra output with *, > and < prepended
. * - indicates additional work curl has done
  > - indicates the data curl has sent
  < - indicates the data curl has recieved

- sending multiple requests
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -I example.com/status/418 example.com/status/418
#+END_SRC
this will send two requests one after the other, providing two sets of results

- sending a post request
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -d 'name=john+doe&course=linux' httpbin.org/post
curl -d '{"name":"John Doe","course":"Linux"}' httpbin.org/post
#+END_SRC
d - data

curl -F "file=@file.txt" example.org/post
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -d @file.txt example.com/post
