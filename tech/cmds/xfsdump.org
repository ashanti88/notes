#+TAGS: xfsdump xfs_filesystem backup


* xfsdump
* Description
This is the xfs specific tool for backing up xfs filesystems.

* Usage
Though you can only have 9 incremental levels, you can have multiple level 1s. So backups can be thought of in series', once the 9th is reached start with a new L1 and this will contain all the previous L2-L9 changes

- perfrom a full backup
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xfsdump -l 0 -f /mnt/xfs_backup /dev/xvdj2
#+END_SRC
l - level of backup (0-9)
f - destination of backup
copy the data at xfs_data to the device at /dev/xvdj3

- perform the first incremental backup
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xfsdump -l 1 -f /dev/st0 /dev/xvdj2
#+END_SRC
