* Description
htop uses around 5 times as much memory
* Usage
** Interactive Commands
r - Renice a process
k - kill a process
shift + p - Show processors by cpu usage
shift + w - write current configuration to /home/$USER/.toprc

** Fields
- PID - this is the process id. 
- USR - who owns the process.
- PR  - Priority of the process, if 'rt' real time is set.
- NI  - Nice value of the process -20 highest to 19 lowest.
- VIRT - Total amount of virtual memory used by the task.
- RES - Non-swapped physical memory a task has used. Resident memory usage i.e. what is currently in physical memory.
- %CPU - Processors share of the elapsed CPU time sine last screen update.
- %MEM - A tasks currently used share of available physical memory
- TIME+ - Total CPU time used since being spawned. This is shown in hundredths
- S   - This represents the state of the process
      - R - Running or runnable (on queue)
      - S - Interruptible sleep (waiting for event to complete)
      - D - uninterruptible sleep (usually io)
      - Z - defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent
      - T - stopped by job control signal
      - t - stopped by debugger during the tracing
- COMMAND - executable that has spawned the process
- LOAD - Number of processeors waiting to use cpu each cycle. 1 5 15 minute intervals.

*** Create a customised top layout
- Pressing f allows you to select which fields to display interactively
- Once you have the fields you like press q to exit, W will save the config to ~/.toprc

** Inspect Individual Process
- this will run until ctrl-c
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ps -cbp 1227
#+END_SRC
c - switch process between exact cmd line input and cmd name
b - batch output, will not accept input
p - list specified process

- this will output 3 iterations
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ps -n 3 -bp 1227
#+END_SRC
