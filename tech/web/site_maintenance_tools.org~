*** Getting Started with CloudFlare - Troy Hunt
**** The CloudFlare Model
+ All site traffic passes through cloudflare before arriving at site.
  - they filter out certain traffic
  - They are gobal so the impact to site should be minimal.
  - CloudFlare actually can increase speed with their practices.
  - contend with facebook and google for monthly throughput.
    - 5 trillion web requests per month.

+ CloudFlare Free Security Features
  - Reputation based threat protection.
    - what action to perform on request based on learning of your traffic.
  - Comment spam protection.
  - Block visitors by IP range
  - Block visitors by country
  - Basic DDoS protection
  - Free SSL

+ CloudFlare Free Performance Features
  - Globally load balanced content delivery network
  - Automatic static content caching
  - Always online
  - Rocker Loader
  - SPDY support
  - Polish and mirage image optimization
  - Mobile optimization

**** Setting Up A New Site
+ add your domain
  - CF will then go and grab your DNS
  - DNS has to be controlled by CF
  - select which DNS records you would like to keep
+ Choose Plan
  - Free or Paid
+ Choose NameServers
  - nameserver will need to be updated on domain registar.

+ Check that site is routing through CF
  - in site page source there will now be a CF section inserted into each page.
  - this can be disabled by turning off smart errors.

**** Setting up SSL
  - the initial setup with CF would only encrypt between visitor and CF, not CF and site.
  - Implementation
    - flexible ssl      - visitor --- encrypt --- CF --- clear --- site
    - full ssl          - visitor --- encrypt --- CF --- encrypt --- site
      - site ssl doesn't need to be validated
    - Full ssl (strict) - visitor --- encrypt --- CF --- encrypt --- site
      - site ssl has validate crt
	
+ Implementing Full and Strict
  - this is all done through the CF web interface.
  - for strict a valid ssl crt is needed on the site.
    
+ Force page ssl
  - redirect all traffic to https
  - page rules allows this to be inforced at CF
  - /* new rule and https always on

+ HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - Browser response header
  - force the browser the make HTTPS requests
  - Define an expiry in seconds
  - include sub domains
  - no more 301 just https from the outset
  - Preload it
  + In CF go to the crypto page
    - only allows https, no http traffic at all
    - all done on web interface

**** Managing the FW in CF
   - Threats
     - Threat score is a key concept
     - it's calculated based on sources such as project Honeypot
     - It can be offset by answering a "challenge"
   - Response
     - Allow 
     - Challenge - test if human
     - Interstitial page - used to test if traffic is legit
     - Block
   - Setting Security Level
     - this is done in the web interface
     - challenge passage
       - this is the amount of time before the visitor is re-challenged
       - this provides the visitor with an alloted window of time
   - Access Rules
     - simple web interface allows blocks of ips to be blocked
     - an entire country can't be blocked, but can be challenged
     - a work around would be to set the country ip blocks explicitly
   - Page Rules
     - are good for automated attacks as they use the interstitial page, but don't stop manual attacks e.g. sql injections
   - CF FW is very good at dropping crawlers.
