** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DtAf3VcZ-Amk][How to deliver outstanding results with technical SEO]]
*** Why Technical SEO
  - low competition
  - faster results
  - scalability across international boundries

- Discovering website
  
- TLD vs Performance
  - .net is the worst as it is tied to no country
  - each country differs
  
- DNS vs Performance
  - check dns provider retrieval time
    
- Time to First Byte
this is built up from:
  Network latency + Backend Processing
  
*** Backend
- Nginx vs Apache
  - These two host the majority of the web
    
Apache 
  - Classic and stable tech
  - not too efficient
  - won't handle high traffic
    
Nginx
  - Can be installed on top of apache
  - handles large amount of traffic
    
- Leavering Caching
  - Browser caching
    - Browser stores reusable files:
      - Logo
      - CSS
      - JS
      - Multimedia
      - Fonts
    - This will allow for faster page render, lower server load, less requests needed to load the page
  - Server caching
    - Stores commonly requested files
    - minimizes web server load, speeds up page load, makes it much easier on a DB
    - Caching static menus in memcache can save 100ms 
      
- Example Server Architecture
1. - web
   - app
   - db

2. - cache
   - web
   - app
   - db

3. - web
   - cache

4. - web

- Enable Server Cache for Crawlers
  
- Enable gzip on the web server
  - online tools can check if it is working correctly
    
- Cache Control Headers
  - if-modified-since
    - super fast time to first byte (when cached)
    - saves bandwidth to both google crawlers and your server
    - only sends what is required(304 not modified)
Googlebot will only crawl if the page has been modified since last if this is enabled
    - Etag can also do this 
redbot.org

- configure Cache Control Headers for:
  - Images
  - CSS
  - JS
  - Mediafiles
  - Fonts 
    
Cache Control Headers
 - save bandwidth
 - faster crawling
 - better server performance
 - higher crawler budget
 - need to be configured properly to work with cdn
   
Content Delivery Network
- CDNs vs SEO
  - Often problematic with SEO
    - Increased TTFB
    - Filtered Server Logs
    - Dynamic IPs
      
How to check if you ip is static - http://viewdns.info/iphistory/

Pushting TTFB to the limits
 - Scripts should load as Async or AFTER the window.onLoad() event fires
 - Window.onLoad() event stops Google's "time spent downloading a page" timer
 - Defer as many scripts to load after the window.onLoad() event fires, as this event is what stops Google's page speed timer

Performance Test Tools
- GTmetrix.com
- WebPageTest.org
- bytecheck.com
  
Sourcecode Vs SEO
 - CSS code bugs and manipulation
   
- Reducing the number of requests
  - create a custom font that contains all your images (fb, twitter, user etc)
    - https://icomoon.io will do this for you
  - Combine JS and CSS
    - can be used for both apache and nginx
      
Javascript and SEO
To check that googlebot is crawling and indexing page correctly use
site:example.com/page

check the cached version, if this returns the correct page OK
otherwise it will not return the content. This is due to googlebot not being able to render the javascript provided

Solutions?
 - Full Prerendering - prerender.io
 - Parial Prerendering
 - Isomorphic Javascript
   
Content
  - cutting excess fat:
    - indexable serach
    - user profiles
    - eCommerce filters
    - parameters
      
Technical issues
  - www vs non-www
  - https vs http
  - //
  - trailing slash at the end of urls
  - indexable subdomains/wildcards
  - staging sites
  - canonical issues (no canonicals, canonicals to wrong url, relative canonicals)

Static Vs Database Driven
 - static relative small
 - DB is endless
 - DB has risk of index bloat
 - DB allow scalability
