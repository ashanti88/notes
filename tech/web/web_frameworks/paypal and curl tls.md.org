Thank you for contacting Red Hat Support. My name is Juan Manuel and I
will be in charge of this support case.

This is a known issue that is being triggered due to recent changes
companies like Paypal made to their web servers. It is currently being
tracked in the following bugzillas:

Bug 1289205 - use the default min/max TLS version provided by NSS
[[https://email.ukfast.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=bf80625343fa48629b56d0e9df2fb2dc&URL=https%3a%2f%2fbugzilla.redhat.com%2fshow_bug.cgi%3fid%3d1289205][https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1289205]]

Bug 1272504 - Enable TLS 1.2 as the default in nss
[[https://email.ukfast.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=bf80625343fa48629b56d0e9df2fb2dc&URL=https%3a%2f%2fbugzilla.redhat.com%2fshow_bug.cgi%3fid%3d1272504][https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1272504]]

These issues are currently in QA, and will be released soon.
Unfortunately we cannot provide a definitive date, although we are in
the process of generating a hotfix to have it sooner.

For convenience, we have attached two files to the case, which contain
the latest builds for these packages, should you need a fix for this
immediately. Please do bear in mind that, since these are in QA and have
not yet been officially released, these packages are provided without
any kind of support. For supported versions of the packages with the
relevant fixes, unfortunately you will need to wait until a hotfix is
available or until they are officially released via an errata.

Please let us know if you need anything else.

Regards Juan Manuel Santos Senior Technical Support Engineer Red Hat
