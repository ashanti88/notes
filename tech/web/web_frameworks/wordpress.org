* Administration
** Login to Wordpress
domain/wp-admin

** Resetting your password
*** Through MySQL
1.Get an MD5 hash of your password.
  On Unix/Linux:
  Create file wp.txt with the new password in it (and *nothing* else)
  tr -d '\r\n' < wp.txt | md5sum | tr -d ' -'
  rm wp.txt
2."mysql -u root -p" (log in to MySQL/MariaDB)
  enter your mysql password
  "use (name-of-database)" (select WordPress database)
  "show tables;" (you're looking for a table name with "users" at the end)
  "SELECT ID, user_login, user_pass FROM (name-of-table-you-found);" (this gives you an idea of what's going on inside)
  "UPDATE (name-of-table-you-found) SET user_pass="(MD5-string-you-made)" WHERE ID = (id#-of-account-you-are-reseting-password-for);" (actually changes the password)
  "SELECT ID, user_login, user_pass FROM (name-of-table-you-found);" (confirm that it was changed)
  (type Control-D, to exit mysql client)

* Tools

* Debugging
** Setting up debugging
+ These are the lines that need to be added to wp-config.php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );

+ this will log any errors in wp-content/debug.log
  - if this file is initially created, jsut create it with touch.

** "No Update Required" after upgrade
[[http://webcusp.com/fixed-no-update-required-wordpress-issue/][URL: webcusp]]
This seems to occur due to caching
1. restart fpm
test
2. clear cache
test
3. makesure all plugins are deactivated
test
4. rename wp-content/object-cache.php object-cache.php.bak
test
5. rename all plugins
