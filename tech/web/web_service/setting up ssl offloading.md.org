Nginx

move the old config files out the way to a nice backed up name.

move the POSTCMP files in place.

restart haproxy, then nginx.

ensure that jparkers.co.uk works ok through ssl offloading.

restart varnish for the x-forwarded-for stuff (less important but might
as well do it then).

if the site doesnt work, move the old configs back in place and restart
again :)
