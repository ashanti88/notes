* Squid Proxy Server
HomePage: http://www.squid-cache.org/

* Files
/etc/squid.conf - the main configuration file

* Description
* Usage
** Install and Configure the Squid Proxy Server

- installation of the squid and squidGuard (in ubuntu it's squid-guard)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yum install squid squidGuard
#+END_SRC
squidGuard is in the epel repo

- check and edit the squid.conf as needed
  
- enable and start the service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chkconfig squid on
service squid start
#+END_SRC

** Restrict Access to the HTTP Proxy Server
/etc/squid/squid.conf
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
acl box_block 192.168.0.15/32  # ip addr to exclude from squid access
#+END_EXAMPLE
the name can be anything

* Squid Guard
HomePage: http://squidguard.org/index.html
Blacklists: http://squidguard.org/blacklists.html
   
- SquidGuard uses blacklists to stop specific domains and urls of a certain pattern
  - the blacklists are added to /var/squidGuard/blacklist/
  - the blacklists are just plain text files that contain a single domain per line
  
- After adding blacklists to SquidGuard a database has to be created
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
squidGuard -C all
#+END_SRC
this will create a .db file

- makesure that the .db file has the correct permissions
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chown squid:squid blacklists/
#+END_SRC

** Hanging Squid Guard Database Creation
I found that if any of the default enteries that specified in squidGuard.conf are not within the /var/squidGaurd/blacklists/ the compilation of the database just hangs and you will find in the logs a something similar to this
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2017-12-28 20:38:50 [1488] squidGuard: ACL destination spy is not defined in configfile /etc/squid/squidGuard.conf
#+END_EXAMPLE
just remove all of this element from the config and db creation should stop hanging
