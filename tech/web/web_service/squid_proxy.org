* Description
* Usage
** Install and Configure the Squid Proxy Server

- installation of the squid and squidGuard (in ubuntu it's squid-guard)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yum install squid squidGuard
#+END_SRC

- check and edit the squid.conf as needed
  
- enable and start the service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chkconfig squid on
service squid start
#+END_SRC

** Using SquidGuard
   
- SquidGuard uses blacklists to stop specific domains and urls of a certain pattern
  - the blacklists are added to /var/squidGuard/blacklist/
  - the blacklists are just plain text files that contain a single domain per line
  
- After adding blacklists to SquidGuard a database has to be created
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
squidGuard -C all
#+END_SRC
this will create a .db file

- makesure that the .db file has the correct permissions
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chown squid:squid blacklists/
#+END_SRC
