Program for providing detection and configuration for systems to automatically connect to network.
* Usage
** Stop the rewriting of /etc/resolv.conf on reboot
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[main]
dns=none
#+END_EXAMPLE
The problem I had was I didn't want my ISP nameserver(192.168.0.1) to be added to my resolv.conf, this key value stops NM rewriting resolv.conf at boot.

/etc/resolvconf.conf
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
resolvconf=NO
#+END_EXAMPLE
