1) Go into /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf and either uncomment or add the
   following:

pasv\_enable=Yes

pasv\_min\_port=40000 

pasv\_max\_port=40100 

2)Restart vsftpd

/etc/init.d/vsftpd restart

3) Then open this port range on the firewall and bobs your uncle

*CPanel*

1) Go into /etc/pure-ftpd.conf and uncomment the following line, also
   restrict the port range:

/ /

 PassivePortRange          40000 40500

 30000 50000

2) Restart the FTP service with the following

/scripts/restartsrv\_ftpd

3) Then open this port range on the firewall and bobs your uncle.

*Plesk*

1) Go into /etc/proftpd.conf and add the following under '<Global>' but
   not inside of <IfModule mod\_tls.c>:

PassivePorts 40000 40500

2) Restart the FTP service

/etc/init.d/xinetd restart

3) Check the Plesk Firewall to see if its on (or is even installed, if
   not then ignore this), if it is then edit the 'FTP Passive' rule to
   use the port range above instead of the default then apply the change

4) Open this port range on the firewall and bobs your uncle.

\_This appears to be down to a new setting that has been added in a new
version of FileZilla which is 3.10. In this they have set the default
encryption when logging on to be 'Use explicit FTP over TLS if
available' instead of 'Only use plain FTP' as it was in previous
versions. This means that for most servers users are able to connect and
login but the directory listing isn't then available as FileZilla logs
in the FTP user in over port 21 but then uses a specified port range
that isn't often open to get the directory listing.

To get this to work I have uncommented the following line in
/etc/pure-ftpd.conf and chaged this to use a more narrow port range:

PassivePortRange          40000 40500

I have then enabled this port range on your firewall which after doing
so means that I can now connect fine using FileZilla 3.10.2 when leaving
the default encryption as it is.\_

to SFTP (only for vsftp)*

Change the following in /etc/ssh/sshd\_config

Subsystem   sftp   /usr/lib/misc/sftp-server

to

Subsystem   sftp   internal-sftp

Then restart sshd
