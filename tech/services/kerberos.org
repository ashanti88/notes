* Description
* Usage
 
** Understanding the Principal and keytab
- The kerberos server stores accounts and keys for systems, the so called service principals
- Every network service to which a user authenticates needs a service principal and corresponding key. To verify the service identity, a copy of that key is required: the so called keytab.
- use klist -k to view the contents of a keytab 
- The keytab for a service is created at the IdM server. If the NFS Server is a different machine, it needs to be copied over to the NFS server; the NFS server must be able to access it

** RHCE Configuration of Kerberos 
+ Red Hat Identity Management

- Based on the FreeIPA (Identity, Policy, Audit) Project
- Provides a number of services
  - 389 Directroy Server is the Main LDAPv3 based Data Store
  - Single Sign on Provided by MIT Kerberos KDC
  - Integrated Certificate System is based on the Dogtag Project
  - Integrated NTP Server (Disable chrony if you plan to use it!)
  - Integrated Optional DNS Server based on ISC Bind Service

- Known Conflicts (these services should be run on another server)
  - LDAP
  - Kerberos
  - NTP
  - Chrony
  - DNS
Indentity Management should be run on its own server

IdM Components and Requirements
- Needs Host Name Resolution (either DNS or /etc/hosts)
- ipa-server package installs Server Components
- ipa-client package installs Client Components
- ipa-server-install is used for easy scripted server installation
- ipa tool is a generic client intrface  
- Authentication can be configured using authconfig
  
Preparing IdM Installation
- Set up host name resolving
- Disable nscd and any existing LDAP or Kerberos Services
- Open the following ports
  - Web
  - LDAP
  - Kerberos
  - NTP
  - DNS
  - Port used by Certificate System

+ Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yum -y install ipa-server bind nds-ldap
ipa-server-install
#+END_SRC
ipa-server-install will prompt for option to be set

- restart ssh to obtain Kerberos Credentials
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
systemctl restart sshd
#+END_SRC

- Verify Kerberos authentication for the default admin user
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kinit admin
#+END_SRC

- Verify IPA access
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ipa user-find admin
#+END_SRC

- IPA Management Interface is found at https://yourserver.example.com

- Create a User Account
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kinit admin
