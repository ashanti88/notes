* Concepts
** Setuid
The setuid (set user id) is a permission bit, that allows the users to exec a program with the permissions of its owner
    
[[file://home/crito/Pictures/org/setuid.png]]
  - the 's' in 'rws' for the user indicates that the setuid is configured for this file
    
- setting the uid
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod u+s file
chomd 4755 file
#+END_SRC
    
** Setgid
The setgid (set group id) is a bit that allows the user to exec a program with the permissions of the group owner.
     
[[file://home/crito/Pictures/org/setguid.png]]
  - the 's' in the group section indicates that the setguid is configured for this file/directory
    
- setting the guid bit
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod g+s guidexample
chmod 2755 guidexample
#+END_SRC

** Sticky Bit
  - This prevents other users from deleting other users files
    - /tmp has the sticky bit set

[[file://home/crito/Pictures/org/sticky_bit.png]]

- setting the sticky bit
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod o+t stick_bit_dir
chmod 1755 stick_bit_dir
#+END_SRC
