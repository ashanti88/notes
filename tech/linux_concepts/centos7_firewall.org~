** Zones
- These are the basic units used to group rules. 
- An interface is assigned a zone, and this dictates the behaviour that the fw should allow.
- These zones allow flexibility for machines that move between networks (i.e. laptops).
*** Pre-defined Zones (least trusted to most trusted)
drop - All incoming connections are dropped without reply and only outgoing connections are possible.
block - Similar to the above, but instead of simply dropping connections, incoming requests are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited or icmp6-adm-prohibited message.
public - Represents public, untrusted networks. You don't trust other computers but may allow selected incoming connections on a case-by-case basis.
external - External networks in the event that you are using the firewall as your gateway. It is configured for NAT masquerading so that your internal network remains private but reachable.
internal - The other side of the external zone, used for the internal portion of a gateway. The computers are fairly trustworthy and some additional services are available.
dmz - Used for computers located in a DMZ (isolated computers that will not have access to the rest of your network). Only certain incoming connections are allowed.
work - Used for work machines. Trust most of the computers in the network. A few more services might be allowed.
home - A home environment. It generally implies that you trust most of the other computers and that a few more services will be accepted.
trusted - Trust all of the machines in the network. The most open of the available options and should be used sparingly.
** Rule Permanence
- Altered rules will take effect immediately, but on reboot will revert to originally set rules.
- The --permanent flag will push the rule to the non-ephemeral firewall. This rule will then be activeated on the next reboot.
