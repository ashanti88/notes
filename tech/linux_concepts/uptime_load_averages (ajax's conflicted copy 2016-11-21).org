Load averages provides an overview of cpu usage.

tools:
+ w
+ uptime
+ top

It is printed as 1, 5, 15 min overviews.

Once 100% of a cpu is reached, software calls become queued

Load average (LA) is an indicator of how many threads are waiting to use the cpu

Simple rules for a single cpu
+ LA is less than one - there should be idle time
+ LA is over one - there are threads waiting and the cpu can be considered saturated.

Multi-Core cpu
+ divide LA by cpu and then use simple cpu rule.

+ Micro-state accounting is what is used to calculate the LA
+ High resolution timestamps are created for each state that the cpu is in.

> prstat -mLc - this proveds infomation on microservice accounting.
