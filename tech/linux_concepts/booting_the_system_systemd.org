* Booting the System with systemd
* Files
/usr/lib/systemd/system/ - this is where the default target files are kept
/etc/systemd/system/     - this is where the user defined target files are kept (this takes presidence over /usr/lib)
* Description
* Usage
- What is systemd
  - this is an initialization system for bootstrapping the user space and managing all processes sbusequent to system start.
  
- Boot Process
  - System power on
  - BIOS loads
  - BIOS scans and hands off to the primary disk's boot sector
  - Boot sector provides the MBR, within the 512 bytes of the active drive
  - Boot loader is executed LILO/GRUB/GRUB2 begins
  - USER INPUT - depending on configuration
    - provide a passphrase for an encrypted disk
    - choose which kernel you would like to boot
    - choose which installed OS you would like to boot
  - Linux kernel is read and executed
  - Device initialization, module loading and the initial RAM disk (initrd) is loaded
  - Root filesystem is mounted
  - systemd runs
  - Default run target is executed (along with dependencies)
  - Moudules indicated within runlevel target are executed
  - Root filesystem is checked
  - Remaining local filesystems are mounted
  - Network devices are started
  - Remote filesystems are mounted
  - Systemd sets the runlevel as indicated in the default target
  - System login prompt is displayed on the console, system is ready for login
    
- Systemd Runlevels
  0 - poweroff.targer (Shutdown)
  1 - rescue.target (Single User/Rescue Shell)
  2 - multi-user.target (Non-Graphical, Full Network, Multi-User)
  3 - multi-user.target (Non-Graphical, Full Network, Multi-User)
  4 - multi-user.target (Non-Graphical, Full Network, Multi-User)
  5 - graphical.target (Grphical Desktop, Multi-User)
  6 - reboot.target (Reboot)
