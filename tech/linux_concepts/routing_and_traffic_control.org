route

*Routing Policy Database*

This allows for multiple routing tables, to cater for different users.

For this the kernel needs to be complied with "IP: advanced router" and
"IP: policy routing".

By default there are three routing tables. Route and ip cmd modify the
main and local tables (by default).

The routeing rules are listed in order precedence.

We see that all rules apply to all packets.

To enable more sophisticated route we create rules which point to
different tables which allow us to override system wide routing rules.

There are types of tunnels in linux:

1)IP in IP tunneling

2) GRE tunneling

3) Tunnels outside of the kernel e.g. PPTP

IP in IP

this uses the two modules ipip, tunnel4 and ip\_tunnel.

> modprobe ipip

this installs all three

GRE

Developed by cisco and is more advanced than IPinIP.

This will require the ip\_gre module.
