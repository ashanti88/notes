* Description
* The Root Directory
To comply with the FSSTND the following directories or symbolic links to directories are required in /
/bin   - Essential command binaries
/boot  - Static files of the boot loader 
/dev   - Device files
/etc   - Host-specific system configuration
/lib   - Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
/media - Mount point for removeable media
/mnt   - Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily
/opt   - Add-on application software packages
/sbin  - Essential system binaries
/srv   - Data for services provided by this system
/tmp   - Temporary files
/usr   - Secondary hierarchy
/var   - Variable data
   
Other Directories
** /proc  - Deprecated filesystem (procfs) is home to system data structures 
- This directory has many status files that can be used to get current operations system parameters
- Many performance analysing tools mine the contents of /proc for data
- Linux can be optimized through /proc
  - parameters are applied in a flexible way through the /proc/sys file systems (in older would have to be recompilied to get the parameters changed)
  - Differnt interfaces are offered through /proc/sys to tune different aspects of the OS
  
- Indside of /proc
  - First you will notice a lot of numbered directories, the number corresponds to the process pid 
    - inside these directories is information pertaining to the pid
    - cat the cmdline file to find out what application is tied to the pid
  - partitions file contains all the partitions on the current system
  - cpuinfo contains details of the system cpu
  - filesystems file tells what filesystems the current system supports
    - if you don't see a filesystem that you tink your system should support missing it only means the modules hasn't been loaded by the kernel 
- /proc/sys
  - this houses lots of parameters that can be altered as needed
    - swappiness variable is housed here /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
