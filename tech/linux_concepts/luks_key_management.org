*Key Slots*

Each partition has 8 slots for eight different keys. Anyone of the keys
can be used to unlock the partition. Once key can choosen or any number
up to 8.

Checking the key slots for the luks partition

> cryptsetup luksDump /dev/<partition> | grep slot

output:

Enabled - this means that a key has been assigned

Disabled - no key has been assigned

Adding new LUKS key

> cryptsetup luksAddKey <partition>

Enter any passphrase - you should enter the set passphrase

Enter new passphrase

Verify passphrase

everytime a key is added it is placed in the next key slot.

Add new luks key to a specific slot

> cryptsetup luksAddKey <partition> -S <0-7>

Delete an existing luks key

> cryptsetup luksRemoveKey <partition>

Delete a luks key using luksKillSlot

> cryptsetup luksKillSlot <partition> <slot>

Add new luks key from a file

> cryptsetup luksAddKey <partition> <file>

file - this is a luks key file. This should be a binary file.

It will not prompt for a new password just to authenticate.

Reset forgotten luks key - Get existing key

If the machine is rebooted and the partition is not able to mount
becasue the passphrase has been forgotten, shit bust, can't get the key.

If the machine is mounted, but you can't remember the password you can
reset the key.
