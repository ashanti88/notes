* Usage
** Disk Layout
- First what is the server to be used for?
  - logging server
  - web server
  - mail server
  - dns server

- Decide what partitions you are going to create, and where they are to be mounted
  - /etc  - has to be part of / and can't be on a seperate partition 
  - /boot - 2GiB is a good amount, remember that you may want to have a couple of kernels, just in case an issue occurs with one
  - swap  - 2 x RAM but not greater than 8GiB
  - /home - This is wholey dependent on what your needs are, in a lot of casues the remainder of the disk is given to /home
  - /var  - This is an important directory that holds logs and mysql data files (if a DB server think of having this on its own partition)
  - /opt  - This is rarely put on it's own partition, but is sometimes
