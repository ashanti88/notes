* Disk Encryption
Luks Homepage: https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/

* Description
LUKS is the standard for Linux hard disk encryption. By providing a standard on-disk-format, it does not
only facilitate compatibility among distributions, but also provides secure management of multiple user passwords.
In contrast to existing solution, LUKS stores all setup necessary setup information in the partition header,
enabling the user to transport or migrate his data seamlessly.

* Usage
** Multiple Encrypted Disks at Boot
- this should only be done if the disk that holds the encrypted key is encrypted
1. Create a random keyfile
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/root/keyfile bs=1024 count=4
#+END_SRC

2. Make the keyfile readonly by root
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod 0400 /root/keyfile
#+END_SRC

3. Add the keyfile to LUKS
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdX /root/keyfile
#+END_SRC
- This will prompt for the passphase

4. Create a mapper
- /etc/crypttab

dX_crypt      /dev/sdX  /root/keyfile  luks

- here dX_crypt is the name that will be mapper to the disk
  
5. Add the encrypted disk to fstab
- /etc/fstab

/dev/mapper/sdX_crypt  /media/sdX     ext3    defaults        0       2

6. Reboot
- check now that the disk is being mounted
