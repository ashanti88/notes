*** Origins of OpenStack
  - NASA and Rackspace worked together to create OpenStack in 2010.
  -Launced as a fully open cloud platform.

- OpenStack Foundation
  - Focus on prodiving an opensource solution to cloud.
  - Comprised of 3 areas - Tech Commitree
                         - Borad of Directors
			 - User Committee

- OpenStack Developer Ecosystem
  - Comprised of thousands of devs
  - individual devs, comapany devs, doc contributes

- OpenStack Releases
  - OpenStack releass are named alaphbetically after storms.

- Release cycle
Plan -> Develop -> Test -> Release 
           |                 |
	   |-----------------|

- There are several releases a year
  
- OpenStack Projects
  - OpenStack tends to split its self into 
    - Dashboard
    - Compute
    - Networking 
    - Storage

- Core projects are considered fully supported.
- Incubation projects are new features.

*** OpenStack Delopyment
- Pre-Requisite
 - Service Dependencies
    - Requires a host OS
    - Requires a db service (normally MySQL)
    - Requires a message queuing service (rabbit MQ)
    - Requires L2/L3 networking


OpenStack uses type 2 hypervisor model

           os                    os          os

- Hardware Deployment
  - Physical hardwate deployed for OpenStack components
  - Services can be co-located for smaller deployments
  - Huge capacity for scaling out.

*** OpenStack Core Services
- Core Services
  - These components are required to drive the OpenStack cloud.

- Minimal requirement
  - Identity services
  - Compute services
  - Image services
  - Networking services
    
**** Identity | Keystone

This performs the following tasks
+ Authentication
+ Authorization
+ Inclues:
  - Users
  - Services - keystone regualtes services access/permissions

+ Uses tokens to authenticate and authenticate and maintain session state information.

- Identity Workflow
 
      creds
user --------> Keystone
  \   <--------
   \   token
    \------------> Compute (Token sent with request)
                       \
		        \-----> Performs authorized action
			
- Tenants
  - These are logically seperated containers within you OpenStack cloud.
  - Multi-tenancy allows for secure isolation using Keystone.
  - Tenants can use global objuects.
  - Tenants can create custom objects within their own tenant environment.
**** Image | Glance
  - Used to store and manage guest images
  - Images can be managed globally and per tenant
  - Users can be authorized to upload custom images
  - Stores images in Swift, Cinder or in the native FS
  - Can be stored remotely (eg AWS 53)
**** Compute | Nova
A hypervisor is required for nova, kvm, xen, vSphere, Hyper-V  etc
  - Compute platform to run our ruest machine
  - Boots instances from our Glance images
  - Currently requires seperate Nova instances per hypervisor
  - Nova is the management platform for the hypervisor

- Regions, Aggregates and Availability Zones
  - Regions
    - logical pools of OpenStack services
  - Aggregates
    - groups of OpenStack Nova endpoints based on Characteristics
      - SSD backed
      - 10 GbE NICs
      - 12 core processors
  + Availability Zones
    - groups of OpenStack Nova endpoints based on location
      - Toronto, London, Berlin etc

**** iNetworking | Nova/Neutron
- Nova Networking
  - It provides:
    - L2/L3
    - DHCP
    
- Different types of IP networks are supported
  - Flat networking - Dedicated subnet with IP information injected to instances at boot.
  - Flat DHCP - Allocates IP addresses to instances from a dedicated subnet using dnsmasq.
  - VLAN Manager - Tenant is allocated a VLAN and IP range.

- Floating IP addresses for public facing networks

- Network types
  - Single Flat - All tenants connected to one subnet.
  - Multiple Flat - Multiple shared subnets. 
  - Flat and Private - Tenants share a common subnet but can also have an subnet which only there machines can access.
  - Single provider router - Provider router gives each tenant its own subnet.
  - Per-Tenant Routers - Provides security by dision of resources. No tenant is on the same router as another tenant. No errors with duplication of ip addresses.

- Neutron Networking
  - The first SDN stack for OpenStack.
  - Renamed from Quantum to Neutron due to copyright.

- Nova limitations
  - Limited by layer 2 boundaries
  - Scalability limitations
    - Vlan limitations (4094 dur to 802.1q standard)
  - Interoperability limitations

- How Neutron works
  - Full SDN platform
    - Neutron is deployed as its own node within the different areas of the OpenStack framework
    - Compute node has a neutron plugin within it.
    - Network node has a neutron stack containing:
    - - neutron-plugin-agent
    - - neutron-l3-agent
    - - neutron-dhcp-agent
    - Controller node has a neutron server.
    
    - Stretched VLAN and overlay networking supported.
    - Lifts limitations from Nova networking model

- 3rd Party Venfors
  - Modular L2 plugin framwork for maximum flexibility and interoperability. Venfors can write software that fits the product by easyily following the api.
  - Muliple topologies:
    - Local
    - Flat
    - VLAN
    - GRE
    - VXLAN
  - Able to tap into the physical networking builds less dependencies on intermediary drivers.
