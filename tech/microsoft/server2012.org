    - min reqs
      - CPU  - 1.4GHz/64-bit
      - RAM  - 512MB
      - Disk - 32GB
    - a good time for upgrades
    - drivers -> mass storage -> unsigned

    - easily managed
      - powershell, srv mgr, rsat, winrs/winrm
    - features on demand
      - reduce footprint by removing payload of unused itmes
    - minimal server interface
      
- Windows Server Migrations
  - Migrate from W2K3 sp2/r2 w2k8 full,r2
                  win-12 full/core

*** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dr3683aneTp4][Introduction to Windows PowerShell]]				    :2012:ps:
- Operating system built around PowerShell
- New version of Cmd prompt
- Combines both GUI and scripting
  
- Getting to PowerShell
  - on taskbar by default
  - on the tools drop down in Server Manager
  - start screen --> PowerShell is one of the tiles
   
 cmd        PwSh                                                 
 net start  get-services | where-object {$_.status -eq "Running"} 
  
- PowerShell can be run in 2 ways
  - Windows PowerShell
  - Windows PowerShell ISE (Intergrated Scripting Environment) 
    - the ise provided tab completion and a list of all powershell cmds to the right

- Simple cmds
- return all commands that are used with service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Get-Command -Noun service
#+END_SRC
this will print a list out with the service keyword

- show all running processors
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Get-Process
#+END_SRC

- show help for keyword specified
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Get-Help process
#+END_SRC

- get possible features that a specified computer has
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Get-WindowsFeature -ComputerName UK-DB-01
#+END_SRC
This will return all features and roles with checkboxes to indicate if the feature has been initiated    

*** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DIFkwRgmEjbU][Installing and Configuring Active Directory Domain Services]] :2012:ad:conf:

- Installing Active Directory
  - Server Manager --> Add Roles --> Features Wizard --> Before you begin (Next) --> Role-based or feature-based Installation --> Select a server from the server pool --> tick the box of the feature you want installed --> prompted with dependencies --> Overview of feature --> Confirm Installation --> Installation Progress --> thiw window can then be closed --> once installed configuration needs to be set

Logical Components of AD domain Services
- Forest - a collection of one or more AD domains that share a common logical structure, directory schema, directory configuration and global catalog
- Tree - a collection of domains that share a common DNS namespace
Parent - Technet.vn
  - Child - video.Technet.vn

- Domin - the core administrative unit of AD DS
- Organizational Unit (OU) - containers n AD DS which provide a framework for administratior and group policy links
- Site - A collection of AD objects defined by their physical location
- Schema - Defines all attributes for all objects in AD
- Partition - Logical secion of the actual AD DS db

Physical Components of AD DS
Domain Controllers - Contain copies of the AD DS DB
Data Store - The file on each domain cntroller that stores the AD DS information
Global Catalog Servers - Domain Controllers which host the global catalog, which is partial read-only copy of all the objects in the forest 
Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODC) - Contain a special read-only copy of the AD DS DB

Configure AD
- default is now set to "Add a domain controller to an existing domain"
- first DC -> Add a new forest -> buttermilk.local -> select funtional level of the new forest and root domain - set to the oldest DC -> makesure to set to lowest level of DC in domain functional level -> Set DNS (recommended) -> have to have at least one GC -> password -> confirm the netbios name (BUTTERMILK) -> specifiy where DB; Log files; SYSVOL should be stored -> review the configuration -> check warnings and install if all ok -> it will now install then restart -> when reconnecting do so using bluelevers\administrator not domain controller
  
- 2 DCs are recommend minimum for all environments
- makesure that the DC has the DNS ip set
