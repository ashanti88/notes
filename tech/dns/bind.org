The db.bind zone file

The db.bind zone file is used to track miscreants who attempt to query the CHAOS TXT records version.bind and authors.bind.  You can also use this zone file to change the strings returned by such queries.  Using the "version" directive in the options stanza will block the version.bind query, but it will not log such attempts.
